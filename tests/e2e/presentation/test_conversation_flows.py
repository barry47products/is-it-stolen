"""End-to-end tests for complete conversation flows.

These tests verify complete user conversation flows work end-to-end with real database,
Redis, and message processing. They are compatible with both legacy state-based flows
and new configuration-driven flows.

The tests use legacy states (CHECKING_*, REPORTING_*) which are deprecated but still
functional. Once Issue #114 Phase 3 is complete and flow_engine is wired into production,
these tests will automatically use ACTIVE_FLOW state without requiring changes.

Future Enhancements:
- Add tests for interactive message webhooks (button/list responses)
- Add tests for contact_us flow
- Test error handling with interactive messages
